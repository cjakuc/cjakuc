My name is Chris Jakuc. I am a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and I am currently enrolled in Lambda School in the Data Science program. My undergraduate degree was in Environmental Studies and I am particularly interested in sustainability. Within the field of data science I have experience cleaning data, web scraping, creating visualizations, building and deploying predictive models, and building RESTful APIs. I am working to continue to build these skills as well as learn more about data engineering and machine learning.

- ðŸ”­ Outside of Lambda School, Iâ€™m currently reading Practices of the Python Pro. After that I plan to do MIT's Missing CS Semester and then start to work on getting some AWS Certifications.
