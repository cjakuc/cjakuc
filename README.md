### Hi there 👋

My name is Chris Jakuc. I am a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as well as BloomTech’s (previously Lambda School) Data Science program. My undergraduate degree was in Environmental Studies and I am particularly interested in sustainability. I am currently a data engineer at [Tort Experts](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tortexperts/). At Tort Experts I use my skills in data engineering to help democratize access to justice for those eligible to be a part of mass tort lawsuits. You can see my portfolio website [here](https://cjakuc.github.io/). Outside of my career, I enjoy watching and playing soccer, cooking, traveling, lifting weights, and playing with my dog Pasha.
