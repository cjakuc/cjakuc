### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris Jakuc. I am a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as well as Lambda Schoolâ€™s Data Science program. My undergraduate degree was in Environmental studies and I am particularly interested in sustainability. I am currently a data engineer at [Entelligent](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entelligent/). At Entelligent I use my skills in data engineering and machine learning to collaborate closely with financial engineers and produce climate-risk analytics. You can see my portfolio website [here](https://cjakuc.github.io/). Outside of my career, I enjoy watching and playing soccer, cooking, traveling, lifting weights, and playing with my dog Pasha.
